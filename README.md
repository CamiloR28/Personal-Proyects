This code will generate a plot showing the base function f(x) along with the transformed functions a(x), b(x), c(x), d(x), and e(x). You can execute this code in a Python environment and view the resulting plots. If you want to change the base function or adjust the parameters, simply modify the function f(x) and the values in np.linspace() as needed.
